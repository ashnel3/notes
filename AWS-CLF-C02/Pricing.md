## Concepts

- On-Demand pricing
  > Only pay for exactly what you use.
- Pay less w/ reservations
  > Some services offer reservation options that drastically reduce cost (See: [[Compute#^aws-ec2-savings-plan|EC2 Savings Plan]])
- Pay less w/ high volume
  > Some services offer tiered pricing to lower cost per-unit at scale.
  > Example: cost per GB is lowered based on storage space used w/ S3
