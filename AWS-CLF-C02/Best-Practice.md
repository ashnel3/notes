## Cloud Computing Advantages

- Trade upfront cost for variable expense
- Benefit from economies of scale
  > AWS is the largest cloud computing company benefiting from massive economies of scale that are unobtainable for most companies.
- Avoid guessing capacity
  > You can avoid paying for unused infrastructure w/ cloud computing. Instead of paying for a limited capacity you pay only for whats used.
- Increase speed & agility
- Avoid expensive data-center maintenance
- Utilize AWS's Global infrastructure
